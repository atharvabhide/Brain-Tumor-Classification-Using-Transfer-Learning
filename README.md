# Brain-Tumor-Classification-Using-Transfer-Learning

Brain Tumor MRI images have been classified into 4 classes by using Transfer Learning Models.
The classes are-
1. Glioma Tumor
2. Meningioma tumor
3. Pituatary tumor
4. No tumor

Currently, the model is trained without data augmentation. In the future, data augmentation will be used on the training images to enhance the metrics.
